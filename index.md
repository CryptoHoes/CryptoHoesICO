Brands like Tiktok, Facebook, Snapchat, and more are constantly creating new 'products' that thrive off the financing of our data without any regard for our 
compensation to the point that virality seems like a gimmicc.

Our mission is to create better platforms by creatives for creatives using the power of Web3.

## Road map

This is ccurrently very fluid, but here is list of goals we'd like to achieve
1. [Build our own original React Native Game to create a $HOES token economy](https://github.com/CryptoHoes/HoesMad)
2. [Circle back to original ICO contract and reevalutaute BSC Drawbacks](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553)
3. [Integrate Tokenomics that are both battle tested and rewarding to investors: Alternating Smart Contract Utility Implementations](https://read.cash/@CryptoSorted/3-ways-to-easily-move-funds-from-one-chain-to-another-7155d6aa)
4. [New products that could exist on the ecosystem](https://github.com/jongan69/SneakerBando-EShop)

Feel free to email if you are a VC interested in guding the project, we'd love to have professional audits/partnerships for investor relations

### [Our ICO](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0xC76F08B7B723d3b0461cEc8206710cd12D71f2a2)

We are a team of independent engineers and investors that are looking to raise funding for such a product in a humble way: Web3

This simple coin on Binance Smart Chain achieves the goal raising initial capital, 
in which we can use proceeds to fund a further token development and then in return compensating original investors in a 1:1 even exchange.

WE ARE AWARE OF THE BSC LIMITATIONS: 

- Node failures
- Binance limited dev support
- Centralization

Our goal is first and foremost to raise capital for project funding. 

Implementation of coin utility is secondary until BSC improves or until we find solutions to mitigating the risks of BSC:
-Altcoin hot swaps
-Secondary token linked to original smart contract
-New chain ICOs if agreed upon by investors.
