# A Web3 platform by creatives for creatives
![CryptoHoes Logo](/Logo.png)

Brands like Tiktok, Facebook, Snapchat, and more are constantly ccreating new 'products' that thrive off the financing of our data without any regard for our compensation to the point that virality seems like a gimmicc.

Our mission is to create a better platform by creatives for creatives with the power and tools of Web3.

## Road map

This is ccurrently very fluid, but here is list of goals we'd like to achieve
1. Build our own original social media platform using React Native to create a $HOES token economy
2. Circle back to original ICO contract and reevalutaute 
3. Use Tokenomics that are both battle tested and rewarding to investors
4. Build a way to have liquidity pools, staking and more!

Feel free to email if you are a VC interested in guding the project, we'd love to have professional audits/partnerships for investor relations

### Our ICO

We are a team of independent engineers and investors that are looking to raise funding for such a product in a humble way: Web3

This simple coin on Binance Smart Chain achieves the goal raising initial capital, in which we can use proceeds to fund a further token development and then in return compensating original investors in a 1:1 even exchange.
